# TendMe#initialize runs the full tend loop (pausing scripts, checking health,
# looping), so we extract the class with load_lic_class and exercise the guarded
# tend on a bare-allocated instance (TendMe.allocate). The game layer (DRC/DRCI/
# DRCH/get_settings/waitrt?) comes from the shared test harness; individual
# examples override return values with allow(...). Every example reads
# top-to-bottom (DAMP).
#
# The focus is tend_wound_safely: a guarded copy of DRCH.bind_wound that only
# disposes a dislodged item while it is in hand, so a maze eject (which clears
# your hands the instant a bolt drops) can never make dispose_trash's blind GET
# grab and trash the character's own like-named ammunition.
